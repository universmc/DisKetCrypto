Last updated: September 19, 2023

Please see our Privacy Snapshot for a high-level overview of our privacy practices.

This Privacy Policy outlines how Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection AI”, “we”, “us”) your personal information through our website – pi.ai, our mobile applications, our interactions with you through other modes of communication (such as SMS or instant messaging), and any other sites or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”).

Our General Approach
Conversational artificial intelligence is at the technological frontier. We believe that this emerging technology will fundamentally change the way that we engage with and think about computers in our everyday lives. Ultimately, our goal is to use AI to build safe, smart, kind, and engaging conversational partners.

Our Privacy Policy reflects our belief that achieving this goal and making the technology truly useful for all will require a deep understanding of how our users talk and collaborate with AIs. As users interact with our AIs, we learn a lot about how to make AI better and more useful to you.

Users deserve transparency regarding how that process works, particularly when it comes to their data. This Policy is one part of that transparency. It documents what data we collect, how we keep it secure, and describes how we use that data to improve our Services for everyone. Here are the top level points:

When you use Pi, we collect data including your name, phone number, and IP address. We use this data to run Pi, inform improvements to the platform, keep you safe, and comply with all applicable laws.
Keeping your conversations with Pi private and safe is our top priority, and we will never sell or share your data for advertising or marketing purposes. We have strict internal controls over the use of and access to user data.
You agree to follow our Acceptable Use policy. When you talk to Pi, you should not try to get it to talk about harmful, abusive, or illegal topics. You also should not attempt to evade our security measures or learn about the models, algorithms, prompts, or source code of Pi. If our automated systems detect this activity, you may be suspended.
You are not permitted to use Pi if you are under the age of 18.
Pi may make up facts, events, or advice. You should never rely on anything it tells you without double-checking the facts yourself or, if appropriate, talking to a professional.

Security
Security is integral to the success of conversational AI: people need to trust that their data is being handled responsibly and safely in order to fully get the benefits of our Services.

Ensuring the integrity of your data is a major priority for us. Inflection AI has technical measures in place to protect personal information against unauthorized access, corruption, loss, or misuse. This includes internal measures that limit access to personal information to a dedicated set of specialist employees working on improving the safety or quality of our Services. Where possible and appropriate, we also deidentify sensitive data like conversational logs to preserve user privacy.

However, these measures are not a guarantee of absolute security and you acknowledge and accept that your use of our Services is ultimately at your own risk.

Also, please note that you are responsible for managing access to any accounts that you maintain with Inflection AI. Failure to limit access to your devices or browser might enable third-parties to have unauthorized access to your personal information.

Third-Party Websites and Content

Please be advised that you may encounter links or content through our Services that are provided by third-parties that Inflection AI does own or otherwise control. You acknowledge that any data you provide to these third-parties shall be governed solely by the terms of service, privacy policies, and other terms applicable to those third-parties.

Retention
Where required under applicable laws, we retain personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, in accordance with our retention policies, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory obligations or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable).

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information, the purposes for which we use personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

International Data Transfers
You will provide personal information directly to our Services in the United States. We may also transfer personal information to our affiliates, partners, and service providers in the United States and other jurisdictions. Please note that such jurisdictions may not provide the same protections as the data protection laws in your home country.

Cookie Policy
Last updated: September 19, 2023

This Cookie Policy explains how Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection AI”, “we”, or “us”) uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our Services as defined in our Privacy Policy. Here, we explain what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

1. What are cookies and similar technologies?
Cookies. A cookie is a text file containing a string of characters that is sent to your device when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. Cookies set by the website owner are called “first party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through a website (e.g., interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

Local storage. Local storage technologies refer to the methods that websites and applications use to store data locally on your device. The most commonly used local storage technology is called “local Storage” and is part of the HTML5 standard. This technology allows websites or applications to store data that persists even after the user closes their browser or application, or restarts their device.

Session storage. Session storage is a feature of your web browser or device that allows a website or application to temporarily store data on your device while you are actively using the website or application. This data is deleted as soon as you close your browser or application, or navigate away from the website. Websites and applications may use session storage to improve your experience and ensure that certain information is readily available during your browsing session.

Other tracking technologies. Websites and apps use a variety of other tracking technologies too, including web beacons (also known as tracking pixels), third-party tracking scripts, and analytics tools. These technologies provide data on how visitors use websites. We may also use web beacons and “clear GIFs” in communications with you to allow us to count how many people read them and to verify any clicks through to links within an email. If you do not wish for the web beacon to be downloaded onto your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “cookies.”

2. What type of information do cookies collect?
We and our service providers may automatically log and combine information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, online resources and our communications, such as:

Device data such as your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers, language settings and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.
Online activity data such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing to the Services, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, duration of access and whether you have opened or otherwise engage with our communications.
We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser.

3. Why do we use cookies?
We only use essential cookies. These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with our Services, by, for example, providing page navigation and access to secure areas of the Services.

4. How can you control cookies?
You can set your browser to block cookies, but then some parts of the Services will not work given that we only use cookies that are strictly necessary to provide you with our Services. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org. Use the following links to learn more about how to control cookies and online tracking through your browser: Firefox; Chrome; Microsoft Edge; Safari.

Note that because these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on each browser and device that you use.

Do Not Track. Some Internet browsers can be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

5. How often will we update this Cookie Policy?
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes to this Cookie Policy prior to the changes becoming effective by posting the changes on this page and providing a more prominent notice with on-site or email notifications. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
